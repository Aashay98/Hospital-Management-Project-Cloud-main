AWS Services: API Gateway, Lambda, RDS, SES, Cloudwatch, EC2, IAM

Language: Python

Web framework: Django, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

To develop this project here we are using some AWS services like Api Gateway, Lambda, RDS, SES, CloudWatch, EC2, and IAM. Along with AWS service here we also use other technology like Python, Django, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and javascript. The application is developed over the Django web framework. The application is hosted over an EC2 server.

The application will integrate into the backend system via API. API will be created & published using API GW.API GW will further forward requests toward lambda

# Service Used
AWS API GW – APIs act as the "front door" for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your backend services.

AWS Lambda - AWS Lambda is a serverless, event-driven compute service that lets you run code for virtually any type of application or backend service without provisioning or managing servers.

AWS CloudWatch - CloudWatch collects monitoring and operational data in the form of logs, metrics, and events.

AWS SES - Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) is a cost-effective, flexible, and scalable email service that enables to send mail from within any application

AWS IAM - AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service for securely controlling access to AWS resources.

AWS RDS - Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a collection of managed services that makes it simple to set up, operate, and scale databases in the cloud.

AWS EC2 - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud.

Django Framework - Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
